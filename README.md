Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a musician turned developer, I've embraced the world of programming, creating applications, and websites. My coding journey began during the lockdowns in 2020, and I've since tackled diverse projects, demonstrating a can-do attitude and a passion for clean code. My multilingual skills, including native proficiency in French and English, are assets that enable effective communication in diverse teams. I'm excited about opportunities to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to innovative organizations, I look forward to discussing how I can make a meaningful impact on your team.
